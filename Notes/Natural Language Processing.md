# Natural Language Processing
## Output
we can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
we can use the `print()` function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here.")
```

## [[Headers]]

## Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by python
This means that the text is ignored.
We use the # symbol to make comments


```python
# This is a comment
```
